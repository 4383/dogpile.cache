   Fixed regression in 0.7.0 caused by :ticket:`136` where the assumed
   arguments for the :paramref:`.CacheRegion.async_creation_runner` expanded to
   include the new :paramref:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create.creator_args`
   parameter, as it was not tested that the async runner would be implicitly
   called with these arguments when the :meth:`.CacheRegion.cache_on_arguments`
   decorator was used.  The exact signature of ``async_creation_runner`` is
   now restored to have the same arguments in all cases.
