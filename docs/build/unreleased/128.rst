    Fixed issue in the :meth:`.CacheRegion.get_or_create_multi` method which
    was erroneously considering the cached value as the timestamp field if the
    :meth:`.CacheRegion.invalidate` method had ben used, usually causing a
    ``TypeError`` to occur, or in less frequent cases an invalid result for
    whether or not the cached value was invalid, leading to excessive caching
    or regeneration. The issue was a regression caused by an implementation
    issue in the pluggable invalidation feature added in :ticket:`38`.
